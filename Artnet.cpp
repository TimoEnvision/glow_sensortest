 /*  artnet to OctoWS2811 test
 
 OctoWS2811 Notes:
 
 Required Connections
 --------------------
 pin 2:  LED Strip #1    OctoWS2811 drives 8 LED Strips.
 pin 14: LED strip #2    All 8 are the same length.
 pin 7:  LED strip #3
 pin 8:  LED strip #4    A 100 ohm resistor should used
 pin 6:  LED strip #5    between each Teensy pin and the
 pin 20: LED strip #6    wire to the LED strip, to minimize
 pin 21: LED strip #7    high frequency ringining & noise.
 pin 5:  LED strip #8
 pin 15 & 16 - Connect together, but do not use
 pin 4 - Do not use
 pin 3 - Do not use as PWM.  Normal use is ok.
 
 Ethernet Notes:
 this was tested using a Wiz820io ethernet module. Standard SPI pin connections, as well as reset on Wiz820io to T3 pin 9
 
 Artnet Notes:
 ARTNET RECEIVER v3.1
 
 This SCRIPT allows you to use arduino with ethernet shield or wifi shield and recieve artnet data. Up to you to use channels as you want.
 
 Tested with Arduino 1.0.5, so this code should work with the new EthernetUdp library (instead of the depricated Udp library)
 
 If you have implemented improvements to this sketch, please contribute by sending back the modified sketch. It will be a pleasure to let them accessible to community
 
 Original code by (c)Christoph Guillermet, designed to be used with the free open source lighting software WhiteCat: http://www.le-chat-noir-numerique.fr
 karistouf@yahoo.fr
 
 v3, modifications by David van Schoorisse <d.schoorisse@gmail.com>
 Ported code to make use of the new EthernetUdp library used by Arduino 1.0 and higher.
 
 V3.1 by MSBERGER 130801
 - performance gain by shrinking buffer sizes from "UDP_TX_PACKET_MAX_SIZE" to 768
 - implementation of selction / filtering SubnetID and UniverseID (was already prepared by karistouf)
 - channel count starts at 0 instead of 1 (the digital and vvvv way)
 - artnet start_address+n is now mapped to "arduino-channel" 0+n (was also start_address+n before), now it is similar to lighting fixtures
